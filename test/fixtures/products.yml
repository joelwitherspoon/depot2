  title: I.R.S. Records
  description: 
   I.R.S. Records is an American independent record label, 
   launched in the United States in 1979 by Miles Copeland 
   III along with Jay Boberg and Carl Grasso. Miles was also 
   the manager of Wishbone Ash, The Police (which counted Miles' 
   brother Stewart as one of its members), and later, Sting, 
   as well as other bands. The "I.R.S." in the title stands 
   for International Record Syndicate (Inc.), as a play on the 
   initialism of the Internal Revenue Service. I.R.S. was the 
   sister label of Copeland's Illegal Records (UK). I.R.S. 
   releases were distributed by A&M Records until 1985, by 
   MCA Records until 1990, and finally by EMI until the label 
   folded in 1996. In 2011, EMI revived the label; as of 2012, 
   the new label has Chiddy Bang and Foxy Shazam on its roster. 
   In October 2013, shortly after the full integration of EMI 
   within its successor Universal Music Group, the label was 
   revived again as I.R.S. Nashville, with Striking Matches and 
   Cowboy Jack Clement on its roster.
